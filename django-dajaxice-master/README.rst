django-dajaxice
===============

Dajaxice is the communication core of dajaxproject. It's main goal is to trivialize the asynchronous communication within the django server side code and your js code.

dajaxice is JS-framework agnostic and focuses on decoupling the presentation logic from the server-side logic. dajaxice only requieres 5 minutes to start working.

Project Aims
------------

  * Isolate the communication between the client and the server.
  * JS Framework agnostic (No Prototype, JQuery... needed ).
  * Presentation logic outside the views (No presentation code inside ajax functions).
  * Lightweight.
  * Crossbrowsing ready.
  * Unobtrusive standard-compliant (W3C) XMLHttpRequest 1.0 object usage.
